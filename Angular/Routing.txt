Routing can be used to make single-page-apps (SPAs)
Back/forward buttons work since activity is logged in browser history

Basics

import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router'; (other modules there too)

<base href>
	Add a <base href="/"> as first element in <head> tag
	Tells router how to compose navigation urls

Configuration
	When URL changes, Router looks for Route to display, no routes originally, must configure

	const appRoutes: Routes = [
	{ path: 'route1', component: Route1Component },
	{ path: 'route2/:parameter', component: Route2Component},
	{ 
	   path: 'route3',
	   component: Route3Component,
	   data: { info: 'The third route'} // read-only data used to render component (breadcrumbs, titles)
	},
	{
	   path: '', //base path
	   redirectTo: '/heroes', //redirect elsewhere
	   pathMatch: 'full' // Path needs to be exact match
	},
	{ path: '**', component: Page404Component } // ** is wildcard, matches everythign
	];

	@NgModule({
	   imports: [
	     RouterModule.forRoot(
	       appRoutes,
	       { enableTracing: true } // 
	     )
	   ]
	})

	Path matching happens in order from top to bottom, first match wins
	Put more specific paths at top and general at bottom. End with wildcard to catch else

Router outlet
	After link match, component renders after <router-outlet></router-outlet>
	Need to place that element manually
