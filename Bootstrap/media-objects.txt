Media Objects

Used to build repetitive components w/ content that doesn't wrap around some item
Think comments/replies, facebook stories, tweets, etc. that all have user image

Structure

.media
  .d-flex .mr-3 (d-flex fixes flex display bug on IE10-11 and mr-3 set margin-right)
  .media-body
    div

Can be nested indefinitely to make reply chain, groupings, etc

.media
  .d-flex
  .media-body
    .media
      .d-flex
      .media-body

Alignment
  Can align media item with align-self-start/center/end

  .media
    .d-flex .align-self-center
    .media-body

  Can change order by changing HTML itself

  .media
    .media-body
    .d-flex

As Lists
  Can use media objects in lots of places, as lists for example

  ol.list-unstyled (list-unstyled clears any list styling CSS)
    li.media
      .d-flex
      .media-body
    li.media
      .media-body
      .d-flex
