Three types: min, max, and min-max

Min heap: value in node is smaller than the values in all its descendants

Max heap: value in node is greater than all its descendants

The min-max heap property is: each node at an even level in the tree is less than all of its descendants, while each node at an odd level in the tree is greater than all of its descendants

Usefulness: a queue where you need to get the min (for min-heap) or max (for max-heap) in constant time
	    min-max has the best of both
	    can use for sorting

Difference from binary-search tree:
	The order of child nodes doesn't matter in heap
	In binary-search tree right node > left node

Implemented as array to reduce overhead of node classes
To get indexes:
	Parent: (i - 1) / 2
	Left Child: i * 2 + 1
	Right Child: i * 2 + 2

Big O:
	find-min/max: O(1)
	delete-min/max: O(log n)
	insert: O(log n)
	decrease-key: O(log n)
	merge: O (n)

Other types of heaps: Brodal, binomial, fibonacci
