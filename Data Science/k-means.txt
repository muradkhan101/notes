Clustering/K-Means

Like K-Nearest Neighbors but we don't have true labels of data points
We just have the inputs x
Attempt to group data into k clusters
Outputs vector of k possible assignments for each data point and
   k mean vectors that define the center of the cluster

Objective Functions for Clustering

argmin(sum i->n(sum k->K[ {ci = k} ||xi - ul||^2  ])  )
Means minimize the sum through all the data and clusters, if the point is in the cluster (ci=k) then add the Euclidean distance from the center of the cluster
Or sum through each centroid k, and minimize the sum of the Euclidean distance of each point in each cluster it is assigned to

Non-Convex, can't find optimal u and c, can only converge local optimum
Can't take derivatives since c is a discrete variable, use iterative instead

Coordinate Descent

Split variable into two unnknown sets u and c
Can't find optimal values at the same time, but
	Fixing u, can find best c exactly
	Fixing c, can find best u exactly
Coordinate descent - hold one set of parameters fixed and optimize other
	Keep swapping held and repeating until local maxima
Algorithm:
	Randomly initialize u
	Iterate back-and-forth between
		Given u, find best c {1, ... ,K} for i = 1, ... , n
		Given c, find best vector u in R^d for k = 1, ..., K
Iterate because finding better c, gives possibility for better u, and vice-versa
Assignment Step:
	Given {µ1, ..., µl}, update {c1, ..., cn}
	L = ∑[k=1->K] {c1=k}||x1-µ}}^2 + ... + ∑[k=1->L]{cn=k}||xn-µk||^2
	Means, minimize the sum of each clusters Euclidean distance
	Pick {c1, ..., cn} to minimize L
	Since each sum of ci is independent, minimize each one independently
	Must iterate across each ci for every point and assign closest
Update Step:
	Given {c1, ..., cn} update {µ1, ... µK}
	L = ∑[i=1->N] {ci=1}||xi-u1||^2 + ... + ∑[i=1->N] {ci=K}||xi-µK||^2
	Means minimize sum of each set of points in each cluster by changing µ
	Take derivative w/ respect to µK,
	ends up taking the average of all the data that was assigned to the Kth centroid
